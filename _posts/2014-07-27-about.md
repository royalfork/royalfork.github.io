title: About Royal Fork
---

A "royal fork" is a chess tactic where a single piece attacks the opponent's king and queen simultaneously.

It's rather poetic.  We have the king; the most important piece in the game which must be protected at all costs; and the queen; a piece stronger than the next 2 most powerful pieces combined.  In the above position, the almighty king and dominant queen both find themselves unescapably ensnared by a single, lowly, well positioned knight.  The royal fork reminds us that it doesn't take an army to push around 2 towering, seemingly unassailable pieces.....just an idea and stellar execution.

I think this serves as a decent metaphor for bitcoin.  Like the knight, Bitcoin has positioned itself squarely between 2 giant institutions; the State, which regulates the monetary system, and the federal banking system, which runs the monetary system.  Unlike the chess analogy, I don't think the relationship between Bitcoin, States, and banks is or should ever be adversarial.  Chess has clear winners and losers; the real world can accomodate success for everyone.

I'm a programmer by trade, but have always been interested in banking, economics, and politics.  Bitcoin is *the* intersection of all the things I love and am passionate about.  This blog will follow my personal journey as I learn more and more about Bitcoin, in all it's facets.

In the next months, I hope to cover, among other things:

- Deep technical dive into the core protocol 
  - Make your own wallet software
  - Broadcast transcations
  - Navigate the blockchain
  - Program contracts

- Describe our current monetary system
  - Outline history of government monetary regulation
  - Compare monetary policies of different nation states
  - Define the money supply and describe how it works

- History of Money
  - How did our monetary policy evolve to where it is today?
  - What lessons can we learn from both good and bad monetary policy?

- Game Theory and Bitcoin
  - What scenarios are good for bitcoin? 
  - How does Bitcoin go mainstream?
  - Economics of bitcoin mining
